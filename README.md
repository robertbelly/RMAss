# RMAss

A C++ program that makes RM assignments a lot easier. 

### Instructions

- Manually determine how many assignments each person/pledge class needs to do for the quarter. 
- Plug them in
- Look at a calendar, count the total number for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
  - Enter the total number and list those dates when prompted 
- Paste the output into a plain text document.
- Copy the document into a spreadsheet and format the dates by week.

Something to note: For some reason, when inputting the dates the program will crash on the first try. Rerunning the program allows the program to complete everything. I'm not entirely sure why this happens.
