# RMAssignments

A C++ program that makes RM assignments a lot easier. 

### Instructions

- Manually determine how many assignments each person/pledge class needs to do for the quarter. 
- Plug them in
- Look at a calendar, count the total number for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
  - Enter the total number and list those dates when prompted 
- Paste the output into a plain text document.
- Copy the document into a spreadsheet and format the dates by week.

### Some Things to note: 

When running the program, make sure you update the working directory of the program, otherwise it will crash. The program needs to be able to find the DXnameslist file. 

For some reason, when inputting the dates the program will crash on the first try. Rerunning the program allows the program to complete everything. I'm not entirely sure why this happens.

This program also assigns setup and cleanup jobs.

Also, don't worry about the other files in the repository. The only important one is the main.cpp file.
